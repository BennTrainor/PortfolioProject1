- The website has three seperate pages, users can navigate to each one using the menu in the top right hand side of the screen. The menu will always show the page you are currently on by showing a bottom border under the relevant page. When hovering over an item on the menu it will also highlight and underline. 

- The website logo in the top left of the page is linked to the home page (index.html) if clicked it will take users back to the home page. 

- The colours used for the website are simple, black white and some aliceblue, colours that match the ghost theme.

- The font used for the headings and menu items has been chosen to appear spooky, however there has been a contrast with a simpler font for the rest of the info on the page, to make it easier for the user to read.
