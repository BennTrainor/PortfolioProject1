## Haunted Walkers

Haunted Walkers is a website designed to advertise events around the UK where participants can have guided walks, tours and hikes of haunted areas of interest, they offer varying walk/hike distances and vary the times the event takes place. 

Website users will be able to find information on events and fill out a booking form for their chosen event. They will be able to see location, time, date, price. The target audience is people who like to walk, socialise and have an interest in the supernatural. 

## Features

## Navigation

- The website has three seperate pages, users can navigate to each one using the menu in the top right hand side of the screen. The menu will always show the page you are currently on by showing a bottom border under the relevant page. When hovering over an item on the menu it will also highlight and underline. 

- The website logo in the top left of the page is linked to the home page (index.html) if clicked it will take users back to the home page. 

- The colours used for the website are simple, black white and some aliceblue, colours that match the ghost theme.

- The font used for the headings and menu items has been chosen to appear spooky, however there has been a contrast with a simpler font for the rest of the info on the page, to make it easier for the user to read. 

## Home

-The first page users are directed toward, there is a hook over the top of the hero image, and some info underneath the main image to tell users about what Haunted Walkers aims to do. 

- The Hero Image matches both themes of ghosts and walking. 

-The transparent aliceblue over the hero image was chosen to look 'ghostly'
